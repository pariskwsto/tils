# Change Site Colors

You can change the colors of a Docusaurus application in `src/css/custom.css` file.

Try to generate a new pallete of colors at this [website](https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout#styling-your-site-with-infima) and replace the styles you get with the existing ones.

For example use the `#26ade4` hex color as primary to generate the pallete
